Plugin that creates a nade trail after grenade is thrown, trail after player and custom bullet tracers. To use this plugin you need to create special addon with either BulletTracers or TrailModels.<br>
As there are a lot of plugins that create trail effect, I thought about creating a particle based on already existing one made by Valve (particles/ui/hud/ui_map_def_utility_trail.vpcf).<br> This version of that particle allows server owners / developers to change colors via C#. BulletTracers allows to change colors, position (start, end) and for some of them to change radius (thicc).
<br>Plugin is an **example** how to change colors, start and end points and radius via C# of particles that use Control Points.<br>

particles/water_fx/waterfall_base.vpcf

I would like to thank my Mom, Dad, my cat and most importantly guys from CSS discord who helped me to figure this out:
- Exkludera,
- Prefix,
- KeePassXC
- Schwarper and his CS2-Store,
- ipsvn and his ChaseMod
